              <p>
                It is the hobby that I practice the most, almost all day and
                much of the night I spend it programming, it is something that I
                really love and enjoy doing.

              <h3>Read</h3>
              <p>
                I usually read when I feel a little tired, it helps me to rest a
                bit from the computer and to think about something other than
                code, it distracts me while I learn.

              <h3>Do sport</h3>
              <p>
                I always take a couple of hours a day to exercise since I spend
                too much time sitting and I don't like to lose physical
                condition, and in this way I release a lot of stress and clarify
                my ideas.
